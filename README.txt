Open main.ipynb on jupyter notebook or google colab and run all the cells in order.
Each section is labeled. All output will go in the ./res folder if saved,
but otherwise, each cell should output an image.

Some cells may take over a minute to run, particularly the cells in section
2.2 and section 2.3. For hybrid images, I always aligned the images using the
eyes but for the bread, I just select 2 points in the middle left and middle right.
